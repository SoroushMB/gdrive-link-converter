A lightweight and beautifully animated Chrome extension to instantly convert Google Drive shareable links into direct, embeddable URLs.

## About The Project

Google Drive is an excellent tool for storing files, but its standard sharing links (`.../view?usp=sharing`) are designed to open a preview page, not for direct embedding in websites, code, or other applications. This extension solves that problem with a single click.

It provides a simple, intuitive interface right in your browser to instantly transform those preview links into a direct-access URL (`.../uc?export=view&id=...`) perfect for `<img>` tags, CSS backgrounds, and other direct linking needs.

### Features

* **‚ö° One-Click Conversion:** Instantly transforms links without needing to manually edit URLs.
* **üåô Sleek Dark Mode:** A modern, dark theme that's easy on the eyes, built with the DM Sans font.
* **‚ú® Smooth Animations:** Subtle, animated transitions for a polished user experience.
* **üìã Copy to Clipboard:** A convenient button to immediately copy the newly generated link.
* **üõ°Ô∏è Privacy-Focused:** No data is collected or stored. All conversions happen locally on your computer.
* **üöÄ Lightweight & Fast:** Built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for maximum performance.
